# EV Thermal & Energy Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains small, explainable Python notebooks for estimating auxiliary (HVAC/thermal) energy usage
and its impact on EV range.

These are intended as concept-level engineering tools with transparent assumptions.

## Notebooks
- HVAC auxiliary energy budget and range impact (starter)

## Planned additions
- Battery heat generation estimation
- Cooling power vs thermal load trade studies
